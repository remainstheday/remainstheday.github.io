          Trenton currently designs & develops interfaces for non-profits at
          iDonate. His dream is to someday work in the Fitness industry
          combining his knowledge of technology and passion for all things
          sports science. When he's not sitting at the computer coding you can
          likely find him studying for the NASM certification, surviving a
          Crossfit workout, or hitting the trails with his dog Marley. Below are
          a few of his projects and accomplisments.

          In 2016 I worked alongside Victor Erixson and the marketing team at
          Redkix to develop their entire digital marketing. This work included a
          custom website, email templates, and a brand style guide. Redkix has

        <h2>St. Jude Marathon Results</h2>
        <p>
          During my time working at St. Jude Children's Hospital I had the
          opportunity to lead a small team in developing an application that
          improves the experience for viewing post race results.¬†With roughly 6
          weeks before race day we successfully designed, developed and launched
          the new experience. My purpose for this project was to provide fitness
          enthusiasts with an engaging user experience for previewing race data
          and to hopefully encourage a cleaner UX throughout the racing
          industry.

          In 2018 I worked as a contractor to help rebrand Pearson Education's
          "Pulse Portal" for mobile and web. The most rewarding aspect of this
          project was supporting over 8 different languages within a single
          interface. The application is invite only based on school district but
