          Trenton currently designs & develops interfaces for non-profits at
          iDonate. His dream is to someday work in the Fitness industry
          combining his knowledge of technology and love for sports science.
          When he's not sitting at the computer coding you can likely find him
          studying for the NASM certification, surviving a Crossfit workout, or
          hitting the trails with his dog Marley. Below are just a few of his
          projects and accomplisments.

        <h2>Donate UI Kit</h2>
        <p>
          a Vue.js component library built specifically for non-profits and aims
          at providing elements often needed to accept donations and/or launch
          fundraisers online. This library does not try to recreate *every*
          component found in other complementary frameworks like Bootstrap or
          Material-UI.

        <h2>Marathon Results</h2>
        <p>
          Every year on December 1st the city of Memphis hosts approximately
          ~26,000 participants running the St. Jude Marathon. With roughly 6
          weeks before the 2018 marathon I led a small team in developing a web
          application that improves the experience for viewing post race
          results.¬† My purpose for this project is to provide fitness
          enthusiasts with an engaging user experience for previewing race data
          and to hopefully encourage a cleaner UX throughout the racing
          industry.
