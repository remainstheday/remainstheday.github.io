          Trenton is a UI Engineer developing interfaces for non-profits at
          iDonate. His aim is to someday combine his knowledge of software with
          a passion for sports science. When he's not coding at a computer you
          can find him surviving a Crossfit workout or exploring new trails with
          his dog Marley. Below are a few of his projects and accomplishments.

        <p>
          While working for St. Jude Children's Hospital I had the opportunity
          to be apart of some amazing projects. One of my most notable
          accomplishments was leading a team in improving the online marathon
          results experience. With roughly 6 weeks before race day we
          successfully designed, developed and launched the

          In 2016 I worked alongside
          <a href="https://dribbble.com/victorerixon">Victor Erixon</a> and the
          marketing team at Redkix to develop their entire digital marketing.
          This work included a custom website, email templates, and a brand
          style guide. Redkix has since been

        <p>
          In 2018 I worked as a contractor to help rebrand Pearson Education's
          "Pulse Portal" for mobile and web. The most rewarding aspect of this
          project was supporting over 8 different languages within a single
          interface. The application is invite only based on school district but
          a preview can be found in the
