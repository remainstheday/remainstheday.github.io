          Trenton currently designs & develops interfaces for non-profits at
          iDonate. His dream is to someday work in the Fitness industry
          combining his knowledge of technology and passion for all things sports science.
          When he's not sitting at the computer coding you can likely find him
          studying for the NASM certification, surviving a Crossfit workout, or
          hitting the trails with his dog Marley. Below are a few of his
          projects and accomplisments.

          In 2016 I worked alongside Victor Erixson and the marketing team at

        <h2>St. Jude Marathon Results</h2>
        <p>
          During my time working at St. Jude Children's Hospital I had the
          opportunity to lead a small in developing an application that improves
          the experience for viewing post race results.¬†With roughly 6 weeks
          before the 2018 marathon we successfully designed, developed and
          marketed the new experience. My purpose for this project was to
          provide fitness enthusiasts with an engaging user experience for
          previewing race data and to hopefully encourage a cleaner UX
          throughout the racing industry.
